What is polymorphism in programming?
Polymorphism is the capability of a method to do different things based on the object that
 it is acting upon. In other words, polymorphism allows you define one interface and
 have multiple implementations.

1. Method Overloading in Java – This is an example of compile time (or static polymorphism)
2. Method Overriding in Java – This is an example of runtime time (or dynamic polymorphism)
