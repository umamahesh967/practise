/**
 * @FunctionalInterface
 * Lambda expression provides implementation of functional interface.
 * An interface which has only one abstract method is called functional interface.
 * It can have any number of default, static methods but can contain only one abstract method.
 * Java provides an annotation @FunctionalInterface, which is used to declare an interface
 * as functional interface.
 *
 *
 * @Why use Lambda Expression
 * To provide the implementation of Functional interface.
 * Less coding.
 *
 * Lambda expressions basically express instances of functional interfaces (An interface with
 * single abstract method is called functional interface. An example is java.lang.Runnable).
 * lambda expressions implement the only abstract function and therefore implement functional interfaces
 *
 * lambda expressions are added in Java 8 and provide below functionalities.
 *  1.Enable to treat functionality as a method argument, or code as data.
 *  2.A function that can be created without belonging to any class.
 *  3.A lambda expression can be passed around as if it was an object and executed on demand.
